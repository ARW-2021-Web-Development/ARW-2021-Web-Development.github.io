            ARW 2021 just got refreshed with It's Museum Day, Everyday! A week-long event for the whole student body of
            De La Salle University that will serve as an avenue for the 50 organizations under Council of Student
            Organizations to introduce themselves. These organizations, divided into 5 clusters, embody a certain theme to present that
            would attract the students and only one cluster will be expected to present each day.
