    '<p>Writers’ Guild is a home for writers from all walks of life. It stands
    for more than just an organization; It is a solace for those who wish to discover
    and explore their passions through writing and literature. Here at Writers’ Guild,
    we have a dream of redefining writing and showing the Lasallian community what more
    than words truly means.</p>'

vision:
    '<p>Writers’ Guild aims to uphold passion for writing among its members. It
    seeks to provide not only venues for inspiration and discovery, but also ways for
    its members to broaden their writing experience. It strives to enhance its recognition
    to the Lasallian community as it attempts to develop the perception of the Lasallians
    as to the value of writing, through course-related and other literary works.</p>'

    '<p>Writers’ Guild shall expose its members to different areas of learning
    and forms of writing as an expression by means of meaningful and worthwhile activities.
    It shall enhance the quality of writing of its members, as well as grow their passion
    for the literary arts. Furthermore, Writers’ Guild strives to enhance its recognition
    to other communities by participating in external activities, creating connections
    with other writing organizations, and being a responsible member of society through
    its socio-development programs, leading to the members’ growth.</p>'
