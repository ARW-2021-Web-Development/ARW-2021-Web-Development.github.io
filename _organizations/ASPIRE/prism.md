about_us:
    '<p>DLSU PRISM is the premier LGBTQ+ organization of De La Salle University.
    It is defined by its commitment to protect and uplift the LGBTQ+ community by creating
    a safe space where members are accepted, loved, and honored for their unique and
    authentic selves. More than creating awareness and inspiring change, DLSU PRISM
    creates opportunities for people to challenge existing norms and take real action.</p>'

    '<p>DLSU PRISM is an LGBTQIA+ organization working in excellence towards the
    amplification of inclusivity, diversity, and advancement of equality. Through our
    projects and advocacies centered on elevating queer discourse, we are able to serve
    the Lasallian community and Philippine society. DLSU PRISM preserves and protects
    the rights and welfare of the LGBTQIA+ community within and outside of the University.</p>'
mission:
    '<p>DLSU PRISM is the premier LGBTQ+ organization of De La Salle University.
    It is a home for allies and queer individuals who envision that LGBTQ+ rights are
    also human rights. Our duty is to actively advocate for social change whereas our
    collective efforts go beyond the vicinity of the university and to a wider range
    of influence. We fully commit ourselves to the aid of the marginalized, united by
    the Lasallian core values of Faith, Service, and Community.</p>'
