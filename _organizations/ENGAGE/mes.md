about_us: "<p>The Mechanical Engineering Society, also known as MES, is a professional
  organization for Mechanical Engineering students. It aims to aid the academic needs
  of its members and at the same time become the official venue for the members to
  show and improve their talents and potential. The Mechanical Engineering Society
  was established in 1977. Together with seven key terminal year mechanical engineering
  students in 1977 (back then, trimesters didn’t exist), Mike Cardenas established
  the MES to replace the old Meng Society.</p>"
tagline: "<p></p>"
vision: "<p>MES’ vision is to become a LEADER among the various professional organizations
  in the university, among the different societies of mechanical engineering students
  in the Philippines, and among the ASME International and ASHRAE student sections
  in the Asia sub-region in the delivery of excellent service to its members and to
  the community.</p>"
mission: "<p>MES’ mission is to promote and enhance the total development – intellectual,
  spiritual, moral, social, emotional, and physical – of all its members through its
  quality programs and activities. MES will be the breeding ground of Lasallian women
  and men aspiring to be world-class, technically competent, and socially responsible
  mechanical engineers.</p>"
